# COMP5416 - Advanced Network Technologies
The codes of this course are basically simulation and Math problems. Some of the answers are not solved until now due to the time limit.
## Language
MacOS 11.0.1  
Python 3.8  
## Assignment1 
See question here: [COMP5416-Assignment1](Documents/2021-Ass1-Question.pdf)  
### Question4 (Max-min Fairness)
Simulate the cwnd changing process and draw it.  
Marks: 15 / 16

## Assignment2
See questions here: [COMP5416-Assignment2](Documents/2021-Ass2-Question.pdf)
### Question2 (Token Bucket)
Modify the M/M/1 queue code given by lab in week8 to simulate a token bucket.  
**This answer is not right.**   Marks: 3 / 20
### Question3 (Multi-thread Server)
Simple Multi-threaded Server. Similar codes can be found anywhere on the Internet.  
**This answer may not be right.** Marks: 20 / 20
### Question4 (BER vs SNR)
Calculate the BER with Q function. It's actually a Math problem.    
Marks: 12 / 20
### Question5 (Cellular network with guard channel)
Still a Math problem. Use python to do the calculation. The problem is that the second question can be solved by simply enumerate every single case and find the optimal solution.
Marks: 20 / 20
### Question6 (Viterbi decoder)
Only simulate the Q1.
**This answer may not be right.** Marks: 7 / 20
